# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Analysis

Heart diseases is a term covering any disorder of the heart. Heart diseases have become a major concern to deal with as studies show that the number of deaths due
to heart diseases have increased significantly over the past few decades in India, in fact it has become the leading cause of death in India.
Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process,
making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project is made to predict heart disease analysis using machine learning algorithms.
project implemented three machine lerning model using sklearn. RandomForesr,knneighbores,Logestic Reggresion algorithams been used to perform heart disease analysis.

[The dataset I used from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

[heart-Disease data set Uci archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)

You can download from any both dataset are same.
